            <p>I have many years experience in IT field since I graduated an University. I do love opensource and am convinced that my current skill set is largely influenced by a variety of opensource projects. Most of my programming knowledge came from the study to understand the well-written opensource projects. Owing to this experience, I try to contribute my spare time and effort to making the opensource projects, that I received many helps, better. I will elaborate more about how I developed my skill set with the help of opensource’s power.</p>
<p>First of all, I start my career with PHP language as soon as I graduated my University. The first task that I need to do in my first company is to develope e-commerce software. There is no one who can advise me to develope the application in the company so I have to analyse the opensource e-commerce software as I need to understand how e-commerce software work. And this approach is still valid for me to develope a software that I havn’t developed before. In addition to this benefit, I also can gain a lot of information about well-written softwares’ practices.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ruby, Python are quite crucial languages that I encountered in developing my skill set. PHP language is more Web oriented language so I can’t think of any usability other than developing web sites. However, when it comes to the Ruby, Python language, they are much more genral purposed language. I can utilize for managing server and task automation such as deployment, test and string parsing and extraction in files. I also deepen my understanding about network programming through these languages since I have developed network TCP daemon server with Python language.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Java is the language that lead me to the OOP world and another JVM language scala also take me to the world of functional programming language. These two languages are very important in my career as these languages allow me to paticipate enterprise level projects. Still, I am not very proficient in dealing with scala language and try to improve on a daily basis. However, it is not easy job to master quickly because of the complexity of the language. It is worthwhile to learn functional language as it open a new viewpoint that I have never thought before in programming.</p>
<p>What motivates you to consider opportunities in Wellington, New Zealand?</p>
<p>In 2006, I have travelled New Zealand for two months. In the journey, I had a chance to visit Wellington and I guess I had stayed there for a week. Frankly speaking, I hadn’t had much impression from Wellington city but the overall impression that I got from the experience to travell New Zealand is never forgettable. In particular, the well preservered nature is the most impressive memory from the travel, that I am able to remember vividly. I think this is the main trait that motivates me to consider the opportunities in New Zealand as I want my children to enjoy such a nice environment.</p>
<p>How does your spouse or extended family feel about a move to New Zealand (if applicable) ? What is your relocation plan? Would you travel first, or would you all move together?</p>
<p>I believe they are all very comfortable to live and adjust new lifestyle in New Zealand as they already had an experience to live in Australia for almost 5 years. I do not think the lifestyle between New Zealand and Australia will be much different. My family members also do not need any period to experience the lifestyle of New Zealand first. Thus, as soon as I got a chance to work in New Zealand from a company, we all together move to New Zealand at once, which also help me to reduce the cost of relocation.</p>
